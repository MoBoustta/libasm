# libasm

## Description

The aim of this project is to get familiar with assembly language.

All source files are:

* written in 64 bits ASM.
* compiled with nasm asssembler.
* written using the Intel syntax, not the AT&T.

I will rewrite the following functions in asm;

◦ strlen
◦ strcpy
◦ strcmp
◦ write
◦ read
◦ strdup
