# libasm

## Description

The aim of this project is to get familiar with assembly language. So I will be rewriting some functions using the nasm x64 assembly and generate a static
library from those source files called ‘libasm.a‘

#### All source files are:

* written in 64 bits ASM.
* compiled with nasm asssembler.
* written using the Intel syntax, not the AT&T.

#### I will rewrite the following functions in asm;

* strlen
* strcpy
* strcmp
* write
* read
* strdup

**Requirements:**

Mac OSX

## Usage

* `git clone https://github.com/MoBoustta/libasm.git && cd libasm`
* `make`
* `make build`
